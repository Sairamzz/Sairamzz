# Hi there 👋 I'm Sairam Sridharan      

## About Me

I am a Robotics Graduate Student at Northeastern University (Boston) with a strong analytical mindset and a passion for solving complex robotic challenges. 

My knowledge and project experience spans across:

- Robotics & Autonomy – sensor fusion, autonomous navigation, control optimization
- Artificial Intelligence & ML – machine learning frameworks, algorithm optimization
- Computer Vision – OpenCV, perception, and vision-based navigation
- Engineering Tools – ROS, Python, CAD design, simulation environments

I enjoy building intelligent robotic systems that bridge the gap between theory and real-world application. Always curious, always learning!!
